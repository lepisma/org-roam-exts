#+TITLE: Org-Roam Extensions

Org-Roam extensions to support better workflow for links and connections between
nodes. An older version was demoed in EmacsConf 2024 [[https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/links/][here]].

Here is what my current set up is like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-roam-exts
    :vc (:fetcher github :repo lepisma/org-roam-exts)
    :config

    ;; Ensure that the side buffer is positioned in the right way
    (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
             '("\\*org-roam\\*"
               (display-buffer-in-direction)
               (direction . right)
               (window-width . 0.33)
               (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer)))

    ;; Enable rich link preview and similar nodes in org-roam-buffer
    (org-roam-exts-enable)
    ;; Setup database for storing vectors
    (org-roam-sem-setup)
    ;; Enable org-protocol for sidekick functionality
    (org-roam-sk-enable))
#+end_src

The browser bookmark is set to the following URL that triggers the sidekick
protocol: ~javascript:location.href = 'org-protocol://roam-sk?url=' +
encodeURIComponent(location.href)~
